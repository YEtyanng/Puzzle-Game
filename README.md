#  N-puzzle

TERM PROJECT for a basic programming course. attempt to solve n-puzzle problems by using search algorithms. The n-puzzle problem in the course is a little different in that one of column-wise ascending, column-wise descending, row-wise ascending, and row-wise ascending can be successfully solved.


Used BFS to find the answer, but it took too much memory and too long. Try to improve the BFS by starting the search from both start and end states at the same time, which can effectively reduce the search time and memory usage.
